"easierData","Internal data required for proper performance of easier package. This data includes: cancer-specifc model parameters learned during training, mean and standard deviation of the expression of each gene across all TCGA cancer types, the list of genes used to compute correlated proxies of immune response, cancer-specific intercellular networks based on literature supported pairs from the Ramilowski database (Ramilowski et al., Nat.Commun., 2015), the frequency of each ligand-receptor pair feature across the whole TCGA database, information on how ligand-receptor pairs were grouped, annotations on approved gene symbols gene signatures included in the immune resistance program from Jerby-Arnon et al., 2018.","3.13",NA,"tar.gz",NA,NA,"Homo sapiens","9606",NA,NA,"Federico Marini <marinif@uni-mainz.de>","list","Rda","easier/easierData.Rda"
