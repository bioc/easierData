\title{Get the frequency of each ligand-receptor pair feature across the whole TCGA database}
\usage{
get_lr_frequency_TCGA()
}
\value{
A numeric vector with the frequency of each ligand-receptor pair feature.
}
\description{
Obtain the frequency of each ligand-receptor pair feature across the whole TCGA database.
Only ligand-receptor pairs with frequency different from zero are kept. Each cell-cell pair
feature score is calculated as the sum of the inverse of the frequency of all the active
ligand-receptor pairs.
